# Budget Genie

Penny Journal is a web application built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase for tracking personal finances. <br /> <br />
I created this app with the belief that tracking daily expenses helps build financial awareness and better money habits. <br />
Users can log their spending, view monthly summaries, and filter records by category or payment method. <br /> <br />
I personally use it to manage my familyâ€™s budget and keep an eye on our spending patterns.
